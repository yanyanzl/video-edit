## subtitle tool: generate multi-language subtitle file (.srt) from seperate language files
### generate a merged file for both subtitles in two files (.srt file)
  - the merged file will include both language according to the time line
  - you can generate a batch of merged files all together
  - in this non-GUI version, you have to name the batch of files according to the rules:
  - executable file multitle
  - source code file multitle.py
  - example: put base_language1.srt and added_language1.srt under the same directory of multitle executable. double click to run multitle executable. then the multi-language subtitle will be generated.
